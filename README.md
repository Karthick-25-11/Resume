I am a recent AWS re/Start Graduate with a strong foundation in cloud computing, Linux, and Python programming. My training focused on designing, deploying, and managing scalable cloud solutions using core AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and RDS.

Through my hands-on experience, I successfully implemented an AWS Three-Tier Web Application, applying best practices in security, automation, and cost optimization while aligning with the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

I am passionate about pursuing a career as an AWS Cloud Engineer or DevOps Engineer, where I can apply my technical skills to deliver secure, efficient, and innovative cloud solutions. I am eager to contribute to organizations that embrace cloud transformation, reliability, and continuous improvement.
